            zero space techniques can be used to transfer data between memory space without requiring CPU to copy data, this techniques can be used within user-space processes (threads), between process (eg : producer =>  consumer) or inside kernel-space process or kernel-space and user-space.
This technique allows CPU to move on to other tasks while data copies or processing proceed in parallel.
This also reduces time consumption in context switching between user space and kernel space.
This allows a better utilisation of CPU.
In the age of big data, real-time processing, and distributed systems, Apache Kafka has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for handling streams of data efficiently. Whether it’s processing millions of events per second or building a scalable microservices architecture, Kafka plays a crucial role in modern software engineering. In this blog, we’ll explore what Kafka is, why it’s important, and how it works under the hood.In the age of big data, real-time processing, and distributed systems, Apache Kafka has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for handling streams of data efficiently.
